# [Portfolio_climate_change] - (https://github.com/rafaelARO13/Portfolio_climate_change)
A example how to analyze subjects in this project me use climate changes around the world. 

we started Choosing the data of what we gonna use in this case we started small with just these data:
kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data

As the objective of this project is an exploratory analysis focused on visual resources, we will start using only Power Bi in case it is necessary a bigger treatment of the data we will use Python.

After all the data are with their correct types, we must begin our exploratory analysis. In order not to get lost in the middle of the data I decided to start with a broader and general analysis and then go on to segment, as we are talking about temperature over time, all the pages are with filters that can be used to delimit the time in years, from the way you want it.
